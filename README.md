One of my major passions in life is technology. After my computer science studies I applied my knowledge and enthusiasm to real-world applications by working in industry as a web developer with passion for front-end and back-end technologies.
Nowadays, I am a product manager in a prestigious tech based company. I enjoy my work, and the contributions I have made in my area of research have earned me a respectable profile. But still I have an itch to make my craft better and stay up to date with the latest and greatest. I am always curious about how people (devs, product owners, designers, managers) around the world solve problems and what I can learn from them.

Looking forward to creating work opportunities and further enhancement of my skills.
