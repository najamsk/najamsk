One of my major passions in life is technology. After my computer science studies I applied my knowledge and enthusiasm to real-world applications by working in industry as a web developer with passion for front-end and back-end technologies.

Nowadays, I am a product manager  in a prestigious tech based company. I enjoy my work, and the contributions I have made in my area of research have earned me a respectable profile. But still I have an itch to make my craft better and stay up to date with latest and greatest. I am always curious how people (devs, product owners, designers, managers) around the world solving problems and what I can learn from them.

Looking forward to create work opportunities and further enhancement of my skills.
