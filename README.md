I am deeply passionate about technology and have always been driven to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world applications. After completing my studies in computer science, I began my career as a web developer, focusing on both front-end and back-end technologies. I am constantly seeking ways to improve my craft and stay current with the latest developments in the field. I am also fascinated by the diverse approaches that people in various roles, such as developers, product owners, designers, and managers, take to solve problems and am always looking for opportunities to learn from them.

I am excited about the prospect of creating new work opportunities and further advancing my skills in the tech industry.

Looking forward to creating work opportunities and further enhancement of my skills.
